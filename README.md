# Heart Disease prediction : Project Overview
![Heart Disease](https://github.com/germeengehad/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/dataset-card.jpg)
- In this project, we will predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using logistic regression based on a dataset of patient information.
- I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing. After that, I will apply a logistic regression model to the data.

  # The Data Set
  - The dataset is stored in a CSV file format on this repo (above)
  - This dataset contains heart disease data with the following columns:
    - Age: The age of the patient.
    - Sex: The gender of the patient.
    - ChestPainType: The type of chest pain experienced by the patient.
    - RestingBP: The patient's resting blood pressure.
    - Cholesterol: The patient's cholesterol level.
    - FastingBS: The patient's fasting blood sugar level.
    - RestingECG: The patient's resting electrocardiographic results.
    - MaxHR: The patient's maximum heart rate achieved.
    - ExerciseAngina: Whether the patient experiences angina during exercise.
    - Oldpeak: The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    - ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
    - HeartDisease: Indicates the presence of heart disease
